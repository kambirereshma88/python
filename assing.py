1.what is diference between high level and low level programing language.

High-level and low-level programming languages differ in their proximity to human-readable language and machine code.
High-level languages are designed to be easily understood by humans and are typically closer to natural language. They offer abstractions and features that simplify programming tasks, such as memory management, syntax, and complex operations. Examples include Python, Java, and JavaScript.
Low-level languages, on the other hand, are closer to machine code and hardware. They provide more direct control over hardware resources but require a deeper understanding of computer architecture and often involve more complex syntax. Low-level languages include assembly language and machine code.




2.Describe python progrmming language.

   1.Open Source : Code that is intended to be publicly accessible is known as open source software; anybody can view, alter, and distribute the code as they see appropriate.
   2.Free : Python is free for anyone to use and distribute (commercially or non-commercially), so any individual or company can use it without paying license fees.
   3.Platform Independent : It means that if we write a program in Python, it can run on a variety of platforms, for instance, Windows, Mac, Linux, etc. We do not have to write separate                                 Python code for different platforms.
   4.Portable : The Python programming language is also portable. For instance, if we already have Python code written for Windows and want to execute it on Linux, Unix, or Mac, we can do                   so without making any changes to the code.
                Simple and easy to learn: Python is incredibly simple to learn and use, and because indentation is used in Python code instead of curly braces, it is very simple to read.
   5.Dynamically Typed : In Python, we do not need to declare the data types of the variables which we define. It is the job of the Python interpreter to determine the data types of the 
                     variables at runtime based on the types of the parts of the expression.
   6.Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language (a programming language that is often interpreted rather than compiled into machine instructions). It is one in which the                     instructions are read and executed by another programme known as the interpreter rather than directly by the target computer and an IDLE (Interactive Development                             Environment) is provided alongside Python. It is nothing more than a REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) interpreter.
    7.Extensible and Embeddable : Python is a language that can be embedded. We can translate some Python code into C or C++ and then compile that code using C or C++. Python is also                                          extendable. It means that we can also extend our Python code in a variety of other languages, such as C++.
    8. Broad Standard Library:You can build large applications with Python, even though it doesn’t check programs before they run. In technical terms, Python doesn’t have compile-time                                    checking. Python supports large programs by connecting multiple modules together and bundling them into packages. Each module can be built and tested                                         separately.   
    9. Supports both function oriented concept and object oriented concept.
    10.Python includes support for testing and error-checking both of individual modules and of whole programs.



3.what is platform independent programming language?

 Platform Independent : It means that if we write a program in Python, it can run on a variety of platforms, for instance, Windows, Mac, Linux, etc. We do not have to write separate Python code for different platforms.
